# Walmart Sales Forecasting with SARIMA
📈 **Time Series Forecasting for Retail Sales Optimization**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **time series forecasting techniques** to predict **weekly Walmart sales**, optimizing inventory planning and reducing stockouts. By leveraging **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)**, the model captures seasonal trends and enhances revenue predictability.

## 📊 About the Data
- **Dataset**: Historical weekly sales data from Walmart stores.  
- **Features**:
  - **Date**: Weekly time stamps.
  - **Store ID**: Identifies different Walmart stores.
  - **Sales Volume**: Historical sales figures.
  - **Promotions & Holidays**: External factors affecting sales.  
- **Source**: Public dataset for retail sales forecasting.

## 🎯 Goals
✔ **Develop a predictive model** for weekly Walmart sales.  
✔ **Analyze seasonal trends** and external factors affecting sales.  
✔ **Improve forecast accuracy** for better demand planning.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Programming**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels)
- **Data Analysis**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering  
- **Machine Learning**: SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA), Time Series Decomposition  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Data Handling**: SQL for data extraction and transformation
